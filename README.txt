Features Implemented:

Use of web services implementing Google Firebase realtime DB to store our user and alarm data and serve this back to the application dynamically. The firebase integration provides increased extensibility and realtime data representation between platforms.
Registration and Sign-in were implemented as well, with firebase as the backend, allowing for simplified authentication and ease of integration with social media.
A simple alarm that can be set and persist through app closure, and device restart was implemented leveraging the AlarmManger API. The last set alarm time is update on the DB every time an alarm is set.

User Stories From Proposal:

We fully implemented the alarm that is cancelable.
We partially implemented the social media alarm sharing through our firebase authentication integration.
We partially implemented the flexible alarm by providing alarm data persistence on the DB.
